      <h3><i class="icon-star icon-large"></i>Our approach</h3>
      <p>We believe that learning to think like a programmer and write good code is more important than any specific skill. That's why our students learn two languages (JavaScript and Ruby), test-driven development, and object-oriented design before ever touching a framework like Rails or Ember.js. We also know that teamwork is at least as important as coding skills, which is why we practice pair programming and Agile development.</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-plus-sign icon-large"></i>How our students learn so quickly</h3>
      <p>A day at Epicodus involves close to seven hours of actual coding, with the rest of the time spent on standups, checkins, and retrospectives. Epicodus graduates have around 700 hours of experience writing real programs, and portfolios of over a dozen open-source projects they've built.</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3><i class="icon-map-marker icon-large"></i>What to expect</h3>
      <p>If you hire an Epicodus graduate, you're hiring a very talented entry-level programmer. Our graduates are smart, hard-working, and have a solid understanding of the basics of web development and object-oriented design. If you use a different technology stack than we teach, many of our graduates will be excited for a chance to learn another set of tools, and will have the ability to pick up those new skills quickly.</p>
      <p>We focus on practical skills and do not teach computer science, so more theoretical programming interview questions you might give to traditional CS students are not appropriate for our graduates. For example, we don't teach about linked lists. If there are specific skills you need that we don't teach, we encourage you to <a href="mailto:employers@epicodus.com">contact us</a> about adding them to our curriculum, or ask your candidates to learn them on their own before your interview.</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-calendar icon-large"></i>How to hire</h3>
      <p>Throughout our classes, we hold open houses where you can see students' work. For the last month of each class, you can host interns from Epicodus (read our <a href="internship-report.pdf">internship report [PDF]</a>). Towards the end of each class, we have a job fair where you can recruit. There's no cost or placement fee to hire our students.</p>
