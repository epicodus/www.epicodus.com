      <p>Thoroughly practice the first chapter of the Epicodus curriculum at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">www.learnhowtoprogram.com</a>. Write a very thoughtful and well-edited response about your experience on the close-knit team.</p>

      <h3>Why don't you offer part-time classes?</h3>
      <p>It takes an awful lot of time to learn how to code well enough to get a job. If you took our four-month full-time class and changed it to 4 nights per week, 3 hours per night, you'd need over a year of class to have the same number of class hours, not including the loss of productivity from not having the immersion of a full-time class. Even one year of working full-time and doing classes every weeknight doesn't seem sustainable to us.</p>

      <h3>How much homework is there?</h3>
      <p>On weekends, there is on average 40 minutes of video to watch. On weeknights, there is on average a 10 minute video 2 nights per week. We don't expect you to code too much outside of class: after 8 hours of class a day, you should let your mind rest!</p>

      <h3>How many students are in your classes?</h3>
      <p>Each class has 60 students in it. Since we pair program, it's important that you are able to find several other students who you are very compatible with in terms of working style and learning. We've found that a class of 60 is a good size where you can find plenty of like-minded pairs - and maybe make a new best friend, too!</p>

      <h3>What is the background of a typical student?</h3>
      <p>There isn't really a typical student at Epicodus. Most have not taken computer science classes in college, although some have. Some have not gone to college at all. Past graduates have been call center staff, sales representatives, security guards, insurance claims processors, and just about anything else you can think of. Very few have worked in tech before.</p>

      <h3>What is the pre-class homework?</h3>
      <p>Before class starts, you need to complete the first chapter of our online course material at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/">learnhowtoprogram.com</a>, which covers the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>

      <h3>Do you help students prepare to apply for jobs?</h3>
      <p>Epicodus's primary goal is to help people learn the skills they need to fill jobs as software developers. If we didn't help you prepare to apply for jobs, we'd be falling short of our mission. We help our students put together a portfolio of code to share with employers, write resumes and cover letters, and practice interviewing. We also host a <a href="job-fair.html">job fair</a> and place students in internships with local companies.</p>

      <h3>How do you handle differences in coding skills?</h3>
      <p>Students come to Epicodus with a wide range of coding experience, on top of which everybody learns at a different pace. We strive to maintain a common breadth of knowledge, while letting students who are feeling confident go deeper into each topic. What we've found is that students' levels of confidence change quite a bit during the class: someone might come in feeling very inexperienced, but after a few weeks, their learning can accelerate dramatically.</p>

      <h3>What makes Epicodus different from other schools?</h3>
      <p>Epicodus is nothing like a traditional class room: it's 100% hands-on, building projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lecture, breakout sessions, lightning talks, you name it. The best way to learn coding is to code, and that's what we spend our time on.</p>

      <h3>How can I best be prepared for class?</h3>
      <p>The most important way to prepare for class is to go through the first chapter of our online course material at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/">learnhowtoprogram.com</a> very thoroughly, doing all of the exercises and making sure you really understand the concepts. Beyond that, we find that students' biggest weakness is usually CSS; a great book to continue working on your CSS skills is the <a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML and CSS</a> book by Jon Duckett.</p>

      <h3>Why do you teach JavaScript and Ruby? Why don't you teach Java/PHP/Python/something else?</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to teach good programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and teamwork. The choice of languages and tools is secondary. Some of our graduates have gone on to work in other languages and with other tools - the important thing is that they left Epicodus with good fundamentals.</p>
      <p>That said, there is a huge demand for JavaScript and Ruby developers right now. Recruiters consistently tell us that Ruby and JavaScript positions are the hardest to fill. Since we're focused on connecting our graduates with jobs, Ruby and JavaScript are a natural place to start. We hope to offer classes in other languages at some point.</p>

      <h3>I'm moving from out of town. Where should I live?</h3>
      <p>Many major transit lines run right by the Epicodus office, making it easy to live almost anywhere in Portland. (Check commute times on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?t=m&daddr=208+SW+5th+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97204&dirflg=r&output=classic" target="blank">Google Maps</a>.) Many students are able to find housing on Craigslist or Padmapper; some find a temporary place on Airbnb when they first move here, as house-hunting is much easier in person. Past students have found student housing at <a href="http://univpointe.com/" target="_blank">University Pointe</a> and <a href="http://arthouse.chnw.org/" target="_blank">ArtHouse</a>. Some students usually coordinate house-hunting through the student email list.</p>

      <h3>Can you help me get a visa?</h3>
      <p>We welcome students from anywhere in the world, but we just don't have the resources to help you out with your visa. Epicodus is not accredited, and in our limited understanding of the visa process, we think that means you would need to come on a tourist visa. Don't take our word for it, though!</p>

      <h3>Are student loans available?</h3>
      <p>Through Epicodus, you can pay $200 up-front, and $600 monthly for 8 months after the class. We unfortunately aren't eligible for traditional student loans or government assistance programs.</li></p>

      <h3>Where is your office?</h3>
      <p>Our office is at 208 SW 5th Ave. It's a big, open, beautiful room with huge windows and super-high ceilings, and our own kitchen space. We're very close to MAX and major bus lines; there's secure bike parking inside; and plenty of parking lots nearby.</p>

      <h3>How do you choose pairs?</h3>
      <p>You choose who you pair with, and the only rule is that you can't pair with the same person two days in a row. In the beginning of the course, we break the class into small groups to make it easier to meet people, and we strongly encourage you not to repeat pairs, so that you get to know more people. As the class goes on, you'll find a dozen or so other students that you'll naturally gravitate towards working with.</p>

      <h3>After the class is over, will I be prepared to learn Node/Mongo/Java/something else?</h3>
      <p>Most of our students have ended up in jobs working with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, but some work in PHP, C#, Java, and other languages. We try to give you the foundation to learn new skills quickly and pick up new approaches after class.</li></p>

      <h3>Can I work while attending Epicodus?</h3>
      <p>Many of our students hold part-time jobs while at Epicodus. They tell us that it's not too bad if your work is on the weekend, but working more than one night per week is really tough.</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>Why are the typical salaries of Epicodus students lower than what I've seen advertised at some other coding schools?</h3>
      <p>Many schools who make a big deal of their salaries have a huge marketing budget, recruit large numbers of applicants, and accept only the very top applicants. We are more interested in working with a wide range of students from different backgrounds.</li></p>
