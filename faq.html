      <h3>Should I take the PHP or Ruby course?</h3>
      <p>Short answer: It doesn't matter!</p>
      <p>Long answer: PHP and Ruby are very similar languages in many ways, but have found somewhat difference niches. The biggest use of PHP is to build web <em>sites</em> whose purpose is to display information. Examples of prominent PHP sites include the sites for <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com/" target="_blank">Sony</a>, and <a href="http://www.beyonce.com/" target="_blank">Beyonc√©</a>. The biggest use of Ruby is to build web <em>apps</em> that allow users to interact and store information. Examples of prominent Ruby apps are <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/" target="_blank">LivingSocial</a>, and <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a>. But there are plenty of apps built with PHP - like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> - and plenty of sites built with Ruby - like <a href="http://www.natgeomaps.com/" target="_blank">National Geographic Maps</a>.</p>

      <h3>What's the application process like?</h3>
      <p>We ask applicants to solve the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/layout-test" target="_blank">layout test</a> and <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/the-ping-pong-test" target="_blank">Ping-Pong test</a>, and to describe a specific time you worked on a close-knit team.</p>

      <h3>How can I improve my chance of being accepted?</h3>
      <p>Thoroughly practice the first chapter of the Epicodus curriculum at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">www.learnhowtoprogram.com</a>. Write a very thoughtful and well-edited response about your experience on the close-knit team.</p>

      <h3>Why don't you offer part-time classes?</h3>
      <p>It takes an awful lot of time to learn how to code well enough to get a job. If you took our four-month full-time class and changed it to 4 nights per week, 3 hours per night, you'd need over a year of class to have the same number of class hours, not including the loss of productivity from not having the immersion of a full-time class. Even one year of working full-time and doing classes every weeknight doesn't seem sustainable to us.</p>

      <h3>How much homework is there?</h3>
      <p>Most evenings and weekends, you'll watch about 20-30 minutes of video. We don't expect you to code too much outside of class: after 8 hours of class a day, you should let your mind rest!</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>How many students are in your classes?</h3>
      <p>Each class has 60 students in it. Since we pair program, it's important that you are able to find several other students who you are very compatible with in terms of working style and learning. We've found that a class of 60 is a good size where you can find plenty of like-minded pairs - and maybe make a new best friend, too!</p>

      <h3>What is the background of a typical student?</h3>
      <p>There isn't really a typical student at Epicodus. Most have not taken computer science classes in college, although some have. Some have not gone to college at all. Past graduates have been call center staff, sales representatives, security guards, insurance claims processors, and just about anything else you can think of. Very few have worked in tech before.</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>What is the pre-class homework?</h3>
      <p>Before class starts, you need to complete the first chapter of our online course material at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/">learnhowtoprogram.com</a>, which covers the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>

      <p>Absolutely. That's the whole point of Epicodus - for you to be able to build things!</p>

      <p>We had our first pilot class in early 2013.</p>

      <h3>Do you help students prepare to apply for jobs?</h3>
      <p>Epicodus's primary goal is to help people learn the skills they need to fill jobs as software developers. If we didn't help you prepare to apply for jobs, we'd be falling short of our mission. We help our students put together a portfolio of code to share with employers, write resumes and cover letters, and practice interviewing. We also host a job fair and place students in internships with local companies. You can see a few of the companies that have hired Epicodus graduates <a href="hired.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>How do you handle differences in coding skills?</h3>
      <p>Students come to Epicodus with a wide range of coding experience, on top of which everybody learns at a different pace. We strive to maintain a common breadth of knowledge, while letting students who are feeling confident go deeper into each topic. What we've found is that students' levels of confidence change quite a bit during the class: someone might come in feeling very inexperienced, but after a few weeks, their learning can accelerate dramatically.</p>

      <h3>What makes Epicodus different from other schools?</h3>
      <p>Epicodus is nothing like a traditional class room: it's 100% hands-on, building projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lecture, breakout sessions, lightning talks, you name it. The best way to learn coding is to code, and that's what we spend our time on.</p>

  <div class="span4">
    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>How can I best be prepared for class?</h3>
      <p>The most important way to prepare for class is to go through the first chapter of our online course material at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/">learnhowtoprogram.com</a> very thoroughly, doing all of the exercises and making sure you really understand the concepts. Beyond that, we find that students' biggest weakness is usually CSS; a great book to continue working on your CSS skills is the <a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML and CSS</a> book by Jon Duckett.</p>

      <h3>Why do you teach JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby? Why don't you teach Java/Python/Node.js/something else?</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to teach good programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and teamwork. The choice of languages and tools is secondary. Some of our graduates have gone on to work in other languages and with other tools - the important thing is that they left Epicodus with good fundamentals.</p>
      <p>That said, there is a huge demand for JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby developers right now. Since we're focused on connecting our graduates with jobs, these languages are a natural place to start. We plan to continue expanding our offerings to other languages.</p>

      <h3>I'm moving from out of town. Where should I live?</h3>
      <p>Many major transit lines run right by the Epicodus office, making it easy to live almost anywhere in Portland. (Check commute times on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?t=m&daddr=208+SW+5th+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97204&dirflg=r&output=classic" target="blank">Google Maps</a>.) Many students are able to find housing on Craigslist or Padmapper; some find a temporary place on Airbnb when they first move here, as house-hunting is much easier in person. Past students have found student housing at <a href="http://univpointe.com/" target="_blank">University Pointe</a> and <a href="http://arthouse.chnw.org/" target="_blank">ArtHouse</a>. Some students usually coordinate house-hunting through the student email list.</p>

      <h3>Can I come see the class?</h3>
      <p>Yes! We have <a href="http://calagator.org/events/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=epicodus" target="_blank">regular events</a> for prospective students.</p>

      <h3>Can you help me get a visa?</h3>
      <p>We welcome students from anywhere in the world, but we just don't have the resources to help you out with your visa. Epicodus is not accredited, and in our limited understanding of the visa process, we think that means you would need to come on a tourist visa. Don't take our word for it, though!</p>

      <h3>Are student loans available?</h3>
      <p>Through Epicodus, you can pay $150 up-front, $25 monthly for 8 months, and then $600 monthly for 8 months ($5,150 total). We unfortunately aren't eligible for traditional student loans or government assistance programs.</li></p>

      <h3>Where is your office?</h3>
      <p>Our office is at 208 SW 5th Ave. It's a big, open, beautiful room with huge windows and super-high ceilings, and our own kitchen space. We're very close to MAX and major bus lines; there's secure bike parking inside; and plenty of parking lots nearby.</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>How do you choose pairs?</h3>
      <p>In the beginning of the course, we randomly assign pairs. After the first couple weeks, we'll make suggestions of people you might work well with. For most of the class, you choose who you pair with, and the only rule is that you can't pair with the same person two days in a row. As the class goes on, you'll find a dozen or so other students that you'll naturally gravitate towards working with.</p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>After the class is over, will I be prepared to learn Node/Mongo/Java/something else?</h3>
      <p>Most of our students have ended up in jobs working with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, but some work in PHP, C#, Java, and other languages. We try to give you the foundation to learn new skills quickly and pick up new approaches after class.</li></p>

    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>Can I work while attending Epicodus?</h3>
      <p>Many of our students hold part-time jobs while at Epicodus. They tell us that it's not too bad if your work is on the weekend, but working more than one night per week is really tough.</p>

  <div class="span4">
    <div class="module mod-faq">
      <h3>Why are the typical salaries of Epicodus students lower than what I've seen advertised at some other coding schools?</h3>
      <p>Many schools who make a big deal of their salaries have a huge marketing budget, recruit large numbers of applicants, and accept only the very top applicants. We are more interested in working with a wide range of students from different backgrounds.</li></p>
