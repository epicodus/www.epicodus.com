    <h2>Apply for our January 5 - May 22, 2015 class.</h2>
    <p>There are two things we look for in applicants:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>You've tried programming</strong> before, so that you know that you like it and can be successful at it. We suggest you go through the first chapter of the Epicodus curriculum at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">www.learnhowtoprogram.com</a>. To make sure that you have tried enough programming to know that Epicodus will be a good use of your time and money, you must be able to solve the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/layout-test" target="_blank">layout test</a> at the end of the first section, and the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/the-ping-pong-test" target="_blank">Ping-Pong test</a> at the end of that first chapter (we teach it in JavaScript, but you're welcome to use another language if you have experience elsewhere). The first chapter is also required homework before the class starts.</li>
      <li><strong>You're a good team player</strong> - we spend almost all of our time working in pairs and groups, so if you prefer working alone, this isn't the right school for you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After you submit your application, we'll contact you to set up a phone interview. After the phone interview, we'll let you know if you're accepted within two weeks. If you're accepted, you'll have one week to decide whether you'd like to enroll and make your first payment.</p>
    <p>We consider applications on a rolling basis. There are no deadlines, but the earlier you apply, the better your chances of being accepted.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions at all, please <a href="mailto:applications@epicodus.com">email us</a>.</p>
