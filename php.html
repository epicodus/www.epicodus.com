      <h3><i class="icon-search icon-large"></i>About the course</h3>
      <p>This course provides the foundations for building websites using the tools and technologies behind sites like <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank">WhiteHouse.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.sony.com/" target="_blank">Sony.com</a>. You'll learn everything from building powerful content management backends to creating interactive frontend user interfaces.</p>
      <p>At Epicodus, our approach is to start by developing strong programming fundamentals using a minimal number of tools and libraries. The first half of the classwork will get you familiar with the basics of PHP, JavaScript, the web, and databases.</p>
      <p>After you have a solid foundation for reasoning about your code, we'll add libraries and frameworks that are used in the real world to make you more productive. In the second half of the classwork, you'll use tools like AngularJS, Ember.js, and Drupal.</p>
      <p>At the end of the course, we'll match you with local companies for two-month paid internships.</p>
      <p>Be sure to also read the more <a href="students.html">general information</a> on our courses.</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-road icon-large"></i>Before starting</h3>
      <p>You don't need any prior education or experience for Epicodus. That said, we expect you to try out programming basics on your own before applying, to make sure that you actually like it. Our litmus test to make sure you've done enough background work is that we ask you to solve the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/the-ping-pong-test" target="_blank">Ping-Pong</a> test and the <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/layout-test" target="_blank">layout test</a> before or shortly after applying. A good place to start learning is the Epicodus curriculum at <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">www.learnhowtoprogram.com</a>; it will guide you through everything you need to know to solve the tests.</p>
