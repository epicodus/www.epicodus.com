This year, I have a job at a place that is genuinely excited to help me learn and grow. I'm really passionate about development and couldn't be more excited to keep learning in this field."</em> - Anna Valkov, Summer 2014</p>

I've worked just over a month now at my new job and couldn't be happier with the position. They seem pretty pleased with my contributions to the team and impressed with some work I've done for them. The internship I did with Epicodus was an awesome experience and invaluable in my job search."</em> - Diego Avalon, Summer 2014</p>
